# Development status

## Agreed next-slice application requirements

21 October 2026: the founder approved SvelteKit/TypeScript web applications and
incremental provider administration alongside the functions being managed. Each
slice assesses its management needs and adds the relevant admin UI and separately
authorized, OpenAPI-defined administration operations in the existing backend.
See [the kickoff plan](IMPLEMENTATION-KICKOFF.md#administration-accompanies-each-feature-slice)
and [applications guide](../apps/README.md). No UI, administration endpoint, or new
runtime behavior was implemented by this documentation update.

## Completed foundation

21 October 2026, Europe/Berlin (UTC+02:00). Steps 1 and 2 are implemented and
accepted by both technical reviewers at the bounded foundation scope.

Step 1 settled the bounded implementation handoff and received engineering and
protocol reviews. See [FOUNDATION-DECISIONS.md](FOUNDATION-DECISIONS.md) and the
two `step-1-*` reports under `reviews/`. Commit: `c5a710c`.

Step 2 implements authorized create/read store and append/read immutable draft
offering revisions through modular JSON/OpenAPI contracts and actual PostgreSQL.
The replaceable Food model validates a small manually available menu; it does not
publish the catalog or validate customer purchase selections. Generated Go models,
client, routing, and embedded contract are committed alongside their modular sources.

Executed successfully: `task doctor`, `task contracts:generate`, `task check`, and
`task smoke`. The check includes contract/example validation, deterministic bundling,
non-mutating generated drift comparison, vet, race-enabled tests, isolated real
PostgreSQL integration, and the non-root API image build. Smoke applies development
role/migrations explicitly, starts API/database, checks HTTP liveness, rejects an
unissued credential through the actual database-backed lookup, and checks SQL
connectivity. It creates no merchant or store fixtures in the development database.

The integration suite migrates a unique disposable database twice and uses the
non-owner `ocp_app` role. It exercises a generated-client store request, read/write
contracts, invalid/expired/revoked/wrong-action/wrong-merchant credentials, forced
row-level security, pooled tenant-context cleanup after commit/rollback, concurrent
revision and retry-key writers, atomic rollback, immutable historical drafts, and
handler restart against retained data. Unit-only runs explicitly skip DB integration;
the dedicated Task supplies a disposable PostgreSQL service and stops it afterward.

No production authentication, storefront, publication, ordering, inventory allocation,
payment, native ONIX runtime, UCP interoperability, merchant transfer, cloud failover,
or storage-loss recovery was implemented or tested in this slice. `services/onix/`
remains a planned integration boundary, not a substitute local discovery service.
No CI, cloud account, real credentials, or research source snapshots were added.

The final `task check` and `task smoke` reruns passed after the review corrections;
local Markdown links passed a filesystem check. `task stop` completed afterward;
development containers/network are stopped/removed and named development data/cache
volumes are retained. Resume with `task smoke` or `task dev`; no host language installation is needed.

Both step-2 technical reviews and their verification/disposition are retained under
`reviews/`. All reported blockers and bounded hardening/maintainability findings
were corrected. The engineering reviewer also executed contract checks, real
PostgreSQL integration, race tests, and the runtime build. These are automated
technical reviews, not independent human or interoperability certification.

Read [FOUNDATION-REPORT.md](FOUNDATION-REPORT.md) for the result and acceptance
boundary. Next: agree the connected restaurant publication/purchase slice under
the kickoff plan, retaining network and payment integration milestones. No next
slice has been implemented as part of this batch.
